This Python project offers an engaging text-based game where players interact with a computer opponent in a mock boxing match. The game leverages the directionsEnum module to handle directional inputs, which are crucial for gameplay. Players and the computer opponent take turns to 'punch', with each move being one of four directions: up, down, left, or right. The game's logic is built using conditional statements and loops, while randomness is introduced through the random module to simulate the computer opponent's moves, making each game unique and unpredictable.

A key aspect of this project is its use of enumerations (Enum) for managing directional commands, showcasing how Enums can be used to create cleaner and more readable code. Furthermore, the game's design incorporates basic principles of game development such as player input handling, computer decision-making, and maintaining game state, recursion, and nested lists. This project illustrates how simple concepts can be woven together to create an interactive and enjoyable gaming experience.
